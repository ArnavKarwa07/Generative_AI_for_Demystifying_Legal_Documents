ClauseCraft™ — Complete Platform Documentation (Expanded scope: Drafting, Storage, CLM)
1. Title

ClauseCraft — End-to-end Generative AI Platform for Legal Documents: Explain, Simulate, Draft, Store, Negotiate & Govern

2. Executive summary

ClauseCraft is now a full contract lifecycle platform that combines generative AI, clause-level provenance, a legal knowledge graph, a drafting assistant, Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) features, collaboration, e-sign, and secure enterprise deployment. It not only explains and simulates clauses but also drafts documents from templates or prompts, stores and versions contracts, tracks obligations, automates approvals, and integrates with enterprise systems — all with auditable provenance and robust privacy controls.

Target users: in-house legal teams, SMBs, law firms, procurement, sales ops, compliance teams, and regulated enterprises.

3. Problem statement (expanded)

Stakeholders need a single platform that eliminates tool-churn across drafting, storage, negotiation, approval, signing, and obligation tracking.

Generative models often hallucinate and lack auditability; enterprise CLM systems lack smart drafting and granular, explainable risk insights.

Small teams and non-lawyers need safe, defensible drafting support with templates, clause libraries, and human-in-loop governance.

ClauseCraft aims to replace a fragmented stack with an auditable, AI-augmented CLM that safely assists drafting, negotiation, and post-signature obligations.

4. Product goals (expanded)

Provide first-draft generation for common contract types (NDA, SOW, SLA, Purchase Agreement, Employment Agreement, License Agreement) with jurisdictional tailoring.

Maintain clause-level provenance in all explanations, drafts and edits.

Offer secure document repository with versioning, access control, and retention policies.

Automate approval workflows, e-signature, obligation extraction, renewals and alerts.

Provide negotiation analytics, redline suggestions, and a lawyer verification layer.

Ensure enterprise-grade security, auditability, and compliance (GDPR, SOC2, optional HIPAA).

Expose APIs/SDKs for integrations and automation.

5. Core capabilities & features

Marketplace: vetted clause packs and template bundles (rev-share model).

17. Competitive differentiation (USPs recap, expanded)

Full CLM + Generative Drafting in one platform — explain, simulate, draft, store, negotiate, sign and track obligations end-to-end.

Clause-level provenance for generated drafts — each drafted clause links to sources, playbook rules, and editable provenance notes.

Risk-aware drafting — drafts include predicted negotiation friction and impact estimates.

Playbook & Knowledge Graph enforcement — ensures corporate policy compliance at drafting time.

Lawyer-in-loop governance & audit trail — every suggestion is auditable and reversible, enabling defensibility.

Deployment flexibility & privacy — SaaS, VPC or on-prem to meet regulatory needs.

18. Limitations, ethical considerations & mitigations

Not a substitute for legal advice — always include warnings and require lawyer sign-off for high-risk matters.

Model bias & data limitations — mitigate via curated datasets, lawyer feedback, and transparent model cards.

Hallucinations risk — enforce citation-first policy, symbolic checks for deterministics (dates, amounts), and mandatory human approval gates for high-risk changes.

Data security risk — follow strict access controls and provide on-prem option.

19. Testing, validation & rollout plan

Pilot with in-house legal teams for iterative feedback.

Human validation sets per clause type and jurisdiction.

Red-team for adversarial prompts and hallucination detection.

Measure KPIs (accuracy, adoption, time saved) and run A/B rollout of new features.

20. Demo scenarios & hackathon pitch flow (concise)

Upload a 2-page SOW → autoscan and show TOC + extracted obligations.

One-click “Generate First Draft” from a 3-line brief → show scaffold + populated variables.

Click a liability clause → show ELI5 + provenance + simulator; slide risk slider to change cap and show impact.

Suggest “Balanced Redline” → show suggested redline + negotiation script; send to approval workflow → e-sign.

Show obligation dashboard with renewal and obligation reminders.

21. Roadmap risks & mitigation (concise)

Data availability for jurisdictions → mitigate with synthetic data + local legal partners.

Integration friction → build well-documented APIs and off-the-shelf connectors.

Enterprise trust → provide VPC and on-prem deployment; SOC2 and penetration testing.

Model hallucination → multi-tier safeguards: RAG, symbolic checks, human approvals.

22. Appendix A — Sample generated SOW (short demo output)

Input brief:
“Mobile app development for XYZ Ltd. Contractor: ACME Pvt Ltd. Deliverables: discovery, UI design, MVP, testing. Payment: 30% advance, 40% milestone, 30% delivery. Term: 12 months. Jurisdiction: India. Risk profile: balanced.”

Generated TOC & sample clause (Delivery & Payment):

Delivery & Milestones

Discovery — 3 weeks — deliverable: discovery report.

UI Designs — 6 weeks — deliverable: high-fidelity mockups.

MVP Delivery — 20 weeks — deliverable: v1.0.

Testing & Handover — 4 weeks — deliverable: test report & source code.

Payment

“Client shall pay Contractor 30% of the total fee as advance within 7 days of signing. 40% shall be paid upon acceptance of the MVP milestone, and the remaining 30% upon final delivery and acceptance. All payments are subject to receipt of valid invoices. Late payments shall accrue interest at 1.5% per month.”

Liability (sample balanced clause)

“Each party's aggregate liability for all claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid under this Agreement in the 12 months preceding the claim, except for liability arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct, which shall be unlimited.”

23. Appendix B — Sample prompt templates (detailed)

Full Draft from Brief
SYSTEM: You are a legal drafting assistant. USER: Generate a {contract_type} for {partyA} and {partyB}. Business summary: {one-liner}. Payment: {terms}. Jurisdiction: {jurisdiction}.

Annotate each clause with [risk_level, mandatory_flag, citations if available].

Clause Alternatives
USER: For this clause: {clause_text}, produce 3 variants: (1) safe — reduces risk to drafter, (2) balanced — fair compromise, (3) aggressive — favours drafter. Provide redline diff and 1-line negotiation script for each.

Template Generation
USER: Build a template for {contract_type} suitable for {jurisdiction}. Include placeholders and a recommended playbook with mandatory vs optional clauses.

24. Appendix C — Suggested evaluation checklist for legal sign-off

Are parties and roles correctly identified?

Are monetary amounts and currencies correctly parsed?

Are dates and notice periods extracted and cross-checked?

Are mandatory corporate clauses present per playbook?

Are jurisdiction-specific statutory requirements referenced where applicable?

Is the draft free from hallucinated legal assertions?
